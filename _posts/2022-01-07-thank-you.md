Dear family, friends, friends of friends, coworkers, community members, and everyone:

We are still processing our grief, and will be, in some manner, for the rest of our lives. But we wanted to reach out and thank all of you for your amazing generoisty and support. We want to thank each of you individually for your generous gifts, but there are so many of you helping us that there is no way we could possibly do this, so we will have to make do with this more generic thank you: Thank you all, from the bottom of our hearts!

At this point we do not know what we are going to do or where we are going to live. We are leaning towards rebuilding, and rebuilding process will be slow and painful. It may be several years before we have a house of our own again to call home. 

In the meantime, please continue to visit our [Amazon wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2LL3FYQESWG0U?ref_=wl_share) for our immediate and short-term needs. Amazon gift cards in any amount are also greatly appreciated. We will never be able to replace our precious items such as my great grandfather's toddler rocking chair or the bed my grandfather slept in growing up, or the artwork Alexander made at school. But with your help we can regain some essential and everyday items.

Many of you would like to donate items that we will only be able to use once we again have a home. At this time we would ask you to set those items aside, or put them in storage, or label them for us and hang onto them. We hope to keep everyone updated as to our progress using this website.

If you would like to donate directly, our Venmo account is [PhilRW](https://venmo.com/u/PhilRW), and if you need it, the last 4 digits are 4670.

Thank you,

:heart: Phil, Kelly, and Alexander
